- I haven't deployed this website in any platform , to see this website you need to clone the repo and run the flask server .
- model accuracy:
| Model Name              | Tr. RMSE | Tr. MA%E | Tr. R-Squared | Te. RMSE | Te. MA%E | Te. R-Squared |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|---------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Ridge Regression       | 3558.67  | 32       | 0.42          | 3457.60  | 32       | 0.42          |
